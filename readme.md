# What is this?

A repo that contains the starter script, the first thing that you need when you begin working here. 
The script installs a few pre-reqs, sets up the docker user group, and sets up SSH. 
This is all needed in order to enable cloning the dotfiles repo using SSH.

# How do I run this?

`curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Centers-Health/bdev-starter-script/master/starter_script.sh" | bash`

# What next?

Use SSH to clone the dotfiles repo and run the system-installer script.
